0.0.5_1 (yyyy-mm-dd)

    API Changes:
        - Object API no longer attempts automatic per-user lock.
          Attributes are taken exactly as they are specified.

    New Features:
        - New functions: lock_user_socket() and try_lock_user_socket()
          that take over the per-user role previously in the object
          class itself.

    Enhancements:
        - Make exported functions non-anonymous

    Bug Fixes:
        - Darwin (MacOS?) also only configures 127.0.0.1/32

0.0.4 (2014-09-15)

    API Changes:
       - Default to 127.0.0.1 on *BSD systems

    New Features:
       - None.

    Enhancements:
       - More informative exception messages
       - Add a demonstration "example/solo" command
       - Use CARP_NOT to generate errors from caller perspective
       - Minor code, testing, and documentation improvements

    Bug Fixes:
       - try_lock_socket now actually returns 'undef' (intead of '0')
         as it said in the documentation. Although this is actually an
         API change the end result should not be different, and no-one
         is using this yet anyway.

0.0.2 (2014-09-13)

    Initial Release.
